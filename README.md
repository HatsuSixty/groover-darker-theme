# Groover Darker

A modified version of [Gruber Darker](https://github.com/rexim/gruber-darker-theme) with pink accent instead of yellow.

## Installing

First, choose a directory where you want to store your themes, then add the path to the chosen directory to `custom-theme-load-path` by adding this to your `init.el`/`.emacs`:
```
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "<your themes directory>")
```
Then you can just download [`groover-darker-theme.el`](./groover-darker-theme.el) into the directory you've chosen.
